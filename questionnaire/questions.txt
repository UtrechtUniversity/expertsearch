These are the questions asked of users during the experiment, translated to English. The questionnaire was given in Dutch using Google Forms. The basis of the questionnaire is the System Usability Scale, extended with other questions

===After using system 1===

Indicate how much you agree with the following statements [1: disagree completely, 5: agree completely]:
I understand how the system finds results
I enjoyed using the system
I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
I found the system unnecessarily complex.
I thought the system was easy to use.
I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
I found the system very cumbersome to use.
I felt very confident using the system.
I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

Open question:
Is there some way the system could better aid you to find the correct expert?

===After using system 2===
The same questionnaire, and then a new page:

Which system has your preference, and how strong is that preference? [1: system 1, 5: system 2]
Why does this system have your preference?
Did you change how you were searching for experts once you started using the second system? If yet: how so
Would you approach all the colleagues whose boxes you ticked?
If you had this type of task during your work, would you use a search engine?
When looking for an expert, when would you prefer to use a search system and when would you ask colleagues if they know an expert?
Would you rather contact an expert through email or telephone?
What helped you assess whether you should toggle an expert as relevant?
Do you have a recent example of when you searched for a colleague or expert?
Do you have any feedback, remarks or insights to share?
